📘Conclusion
The Horror Movies Hollywood Investments Project demonstrates the high return-on-investment (ROI) potential of horror films in the Hollywood industry. With only 10 billion USD in total budget, horror films achieved a domestic gross of 69.89 billion USD, rivaling higher-budget genres like Action (65.82bn) and Drama (70.85bn).
Despite having the lowest production allocation, horror films captured over 22.5% of total domestic gross, showcasing their financial efficiency and audience popularity.
In contrast, genres like Action (84bn) and Drama (54bn) required significantly higher budgets to achieve similar or only slightly better gross outcomes, revealing a case of diminishing returns on higher investments.
The MPAA rating analysis further supports strategic planning. PG-13 rated films generated the highest total revenue, likely due to their broader audience reach. Meanwhile, R-rated films, typical for horror, maintained strong performance, proving that age restrictions do not always reduce profitability if targeted correctly.
Additionally, the monthly performance chart shows a spike in both domestic and worldwide gross during mid-year releases, suggesting seasonal timing is crucial to maximizing revenue.
